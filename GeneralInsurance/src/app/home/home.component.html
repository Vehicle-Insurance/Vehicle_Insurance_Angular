           <b>Why do I need to insure my car?</b><br>
           In India, third-party car insurance is compulsory for all car owners. Moreover, own-damage car insurance covers you in case of accidents, theft and fire. In case of any untoward incident, you don't have to pay out of pocket for repairs or replacement if you have a valid insurance policy.        <br><br>
            <b>What are the risks covered by Private Car Package Insurance Policy?</b><br>
            Car insurance covers damages to your own car, as well as the damages your car makes to others & surrounding property. Some of the risks it covers include fire, theft, natural calamities, explosion and self-ignition.    
    
            <br><br>
            <b>What is personal accident insurance cover?</b><br>
            Personal accident insurance covers death or disability caused due to an unfortunate accident. The motor insurance policy essentially has a personal accident cover for the registered owner-driver, as per tariff, for which no extra premium is to be paid. For a person other than the registered owner and driver, the personal accident cover has to be purchased separately by paying an additional premium. The amount paid as compensation depends upon the extent of opted cover.
